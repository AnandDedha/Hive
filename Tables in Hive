********************* TABLE TYPE AND ITS USAGE *************************
1 Internal Tables
2 External Tables


** Internal tables **

	- Internal Table is tightly coupled in nature.In this type of table, first we have to create table and load the data.
	- We can call this one as data on schema.
	- By dropping this table, both data and schema will be removed.
	- The stored location of this table will be at /user/hive/warehouse.

When to Choose Internal Table:

	- If the processing data available in local file system
	- If we want Hive to manage the complete life cycle of data including the deletion

	
Sample code snippet
// To create the Table 

CREATE TABLE hive_internaltable (id INT,Name STRING);
	 Row format delimited 
	 Fields terminated by '\t';

//Load the data into the table

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/guru99hive/data.txt' INTO table guruhive_internaltable;	 


** External tables **

	- External Table is loosely coupled in nature. Data will be available in HDFS.The table is going to create on HDFS data.
	- In other way, we can say like its creating schema on data.
	- At the time of dropping the table it drops only schema, the data will be still available in HDFS as before.
	- External tables provide an option to create multiple schema's for the data stored in HDFS instead of deleting the data every time whenever schema updates
When to Choose External Table:

	- If processing data available in HDFS
	- Useful when the files are being used outside of Hive
